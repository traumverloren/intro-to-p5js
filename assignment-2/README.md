# Assignment 2: Patterns with Loops - Focus on parameters

#### For this assignment:

Using only grayscale values—including transparent grays—develop an abstract pattern reflecting the structure of one of your favorite songs. Use three or more `for` structures. Use variables to define at least 2 parameters for the program. When you change the values of these variables the program should change.

Requirements:
  - Use 2 or more variables to parameterize the design
  - Use nested `for` loop
  - Use at least 3 `for` loops
  - Use at least 2 p5js Shape functions
    - Use builtin shape functions: `line()`, `ellipse()`, `rect()`, `arc()`, `vertex()`, etc.
  - Use only Grayscale
  - Use a color with an alpha less than 255
Use a transparent grayscale value for your `stroke()`, `fill()`, `background()`, or `color()` values.

#### And my final sketch:
