# Assignment 3: Expressive Eyes

#### For this assignment:

Create a pair of expressive eyes that respond to the cursor as a 1024 x 768 pixel p5.js program. Develop an original and unique set of eyes with an engaging relationship to the cursor. They can be human eyes, robot eyes, fox eyes, monster eyes, octopus eyes, manga eyes -- just about any pair of eyes you can imagine. Your software should display only the eyes, no other visual clues like a nose or background. The eyes can feel like a cartoon, abstracted geometry, extremely realistic, etc., but remember, the focus is on how the eyes respond, not just on how they look. Many aspects of the mouse location and its rhythm can be used (state, position, distance, speed, orientation). Make sure to include a specific response to mouse clicks.

Requirements:
  - Canvas is 1024x768
  - Use 2 or more variables
  - Use shape functions
    - Use at least 4 builtin p5js drawing functions: line(), ellipse(), rect(), arc(), vertex(), etc.
  - Use 2 conditionals
    - Use at least one 'if' and one 'else' or 'else if' to control your sketch.
  - Responds to mouse position
    - Use mouseX and mouseY
  - Responds to mouse velocity
    - Calculate velocity using pmouseX and pmouseY
  - Responds to mouse click
    - Use mouseIsPressed or mousePressed().
  - Extreme change with mouse movement
    - Large or fast mouse movements should trigger a big visual response from your expressive eyes.
  - Program Runs without Errors
  - Craft in drawing the Eyes
    - Assess how much creativity and effort went into these expressive eyes. Are they simple circles? Do the display a range of emotions?
    - Give some feedback about the the relationship of the eyes to the cursor and your overall impression of their assignment.
